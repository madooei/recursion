In this lesson you will learn about a very powerful programming technique called __recursion__. 
In a nutshell, recursion is a technique by which a function makes (one or more) calls to itself
during execution. 

In computing, recursion provides a powerful technique for problem solving. 
It is a different way of thinking about problems which often leads to elegant solutions.

In programming, it often leads to much shorter code to solve difficult problems.
Recursion is also an important technique in the study of data structures and algorithms.
Moreover, recursion (in a more Mathematical sense) is studied in the theory of computation as well. 

I will use a number of illustrative examples throughout this lesson to introduce you to the idea of recursion 
when it comes to programming and problem solving. More concretely, we will talk about:
* Recursive definition (Factorial function)
* Recurrence relation (Fibonacci sequence)
* How do we implement recursion (base case, recursive case)
* How computers handle recursion (call stack, recursion tree)
* Algorithms that use recursion (Greatest Common Divisor)
* Recursive thinking and problem solving (Towers of Hanoi)

By the end of this lesson, it is hoped that you 
* Become more comfortable writing recursive algorithms.
* To discover the relationship and difference between recursion and iteration.
* Convert between iterative and recursive algorithms.
* Describe how a computer implements recursion.
* Draw a recursion tree for a recursive algorithm.
